      Haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry. They consist of 3 lines. The content can anything! However, the first line is always 5 syllables, the second is 7 syllables, and the third is 5 syllables again. Haikus also rarely ryhyme.

      Use Haikuit to easily check your syllables and to save all your haikus! Happy haikuing!
